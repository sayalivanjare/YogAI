## **Project Overview**
**YogAI** is a real-time yoga posture detection system that combines **computer vision** (MediaPipe + OpenCV) with a **smart pressure mat** to analyze user posture. The system detects misalignments and provides **instant visual and voice feedback** through an interactive **Streamlit GUI**.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Vision + Pressure Mat Fusion:** Accurate posture detection using both camera and mat inputs  
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Supports Tree Pose, Tadasana, Namaste, Chair Pose  
- **Voice Guidance:** Hands-free instructions using `pyttsx3`  
- **Interactive GUI:** Live camera feed and posture overlays with corrections  
- **Extensible:** Easy to add new poses or connect to a mobile app  

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Python** – Core logic  
- **OpenCV + Mediapipe** – Real-time pose estimation  
- **Streamlit** – GUI & dashboard  
- **Pyttsx3** – Voice feedback  
- **Velostat + Microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino)** – Pressure sensing

## **Installation & Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sayalivanjare/yoga-pose-coach.git
cd yoga-pose-coach
````

2. Install dependencies:
